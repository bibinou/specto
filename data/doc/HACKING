Basic rules:
============
When editing files, please set your favorite editor to use SPACES instead of tabs.
Please set it so that it uses exactly 4 spaces. This is a coding convention to
prevent python from messing up with our indentation.

If you are not sure of something, experiment, or ask on the channel. Have fun !



Some file definitions :
=======================
  ./setup.py : The file used to install the program in the system. It can be compared to a ./configure; make; sudo make install, but for python.
  ./specto : The base executable. It should be really simple, and contains imports of modules (trayicon for the moment), command line usage, argument parsing.
  ./spectlib/ : The modules sources. All the functionality code should be here.
            .../__init__.py : to comply with setup.py, the directory needs an __init__.py. We leave it empty for the moment.
            .../main.py : the core of specto. All other modules communicate MUST communicate with this one.
            .../notifier.py : The source code of the main notifying window.
            .../preferences.py : The source code of the preferences window.
            .../trayicon.py : The trayicon is the icon shown in the panel notification area.
            .../util.py : Every utility function should be written here.
            .../logger.py : A module for logging debug and info messages for the user
            .../networkmanager.py : If available, bind into NetworkManager (a very nifty network daemon)
            .../iniparser.py : a module that reads and writes to configuration files
            .../specto_gconf.py : the gconf binding for specto that allows managing simple preferences
            etc
