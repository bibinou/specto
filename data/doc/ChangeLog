Specto 0.3: 2009 01 ??
======================
- There is a lot of new undocumented (sometimes hidden) features. Grep "##DOC"
- The facebook watch is still not working.

Upgrading to this release is strongly recommended, as it solves a huge amount of issues reported in the 0.2.x series, is more stable, implements new features, is more secure and easier to maintain.
This release contains lots of architectural changes. The watch system is now a plugin system, the watch list has changed, GNOME keyring is now used for encrypting passwords by default (though you can disable it), and the configuration/cache directories are now based on the XDG user directory specification. As such, you will need to import your watch list if upgrading from Specto 0.2.x. You may also need to reset (overwrite) your passwords, or convert them to plain text before upgrading.
