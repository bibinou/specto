    * Fix issue #4: content is left aligned
    * Fix issue #30: sort order is correctly saved
    * Fix issue #34: "display all watches" is checked at startup
    * extend the pango ellipsize behavior to a few other labels in the notifier window

2007-01-20 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * use pango to ellipsize (truncate) the webpage URIs shown in the notifier window. Better results and less hacks.

2007-01-05 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * late happy new year, folks :)
    * added back the launch.sh script. This is used only for those who do not want to install Specto and who face gnome's stupid launchers. Starting 
"specto" directly still works though.

2006-12-26 Wout Clymans
    * Export watches implemented

2006-12-23 Jean-Francois Fortin

2006-12-15 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Partially fix issue #30 that made the sorting order change on startup, this also fixes a gmail watch bug at the same time
    * Remove some useless translated strings, update de, fr, sv (thanks Daniel Nylander), it (thanks Giulio lotti) translations

2006-12-15 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Fixed issue #9, Specto can now be fully translated. Yes, that means glade files too! Go ahead and make Specto beautiful in your native language!

    * Fixed translations that use plurals in our code

2006-12-15 Wout Clymans
    * Fixed issue #10 specto uses threads to update watches

2006-12-12 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Finally killed libegg and use PyGTK's gtk.StatusIcon instead (fixes issue #8, requires pygtk 2.10)
    * The tray icon is not persistent as a default: you have to enable it in the preferences now. This is for HIG purposes.
    * Killed the traypopup module, it really was useless, I merged it in trayicon
    * Libnotify balloons are finally attached to the tray icon!
    * Make the utils module return absolute paths

    * Add the SV translation taken from Rosetta (Daniel Nylander)

2006-11-18 Jean-François Fortin
    * Feature added: checks for network connectivity before starting by trying to open google.com. If it fails, it sleeps for 10 seconds.

2006-11-12 Thomas McColgan
    * Specto now runs locally. This breaks setup.py and the ability to install Specto system-wide.

2006-10-26 Wout Clymans
    * Added SSL support for pop3/imap email watches

2006-10-24 Giulio lotti, Jean-François Fortin & Thomas McColgan

2006-09-13 Jean-François Fortin
