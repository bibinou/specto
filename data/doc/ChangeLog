    * corrected some errors in the French translation
    * added Spanish translation (Nicolas Espina Tacchetti)
    * fix issue #59, invalid specto.desktop file (patch by sas.dean)~
    * fix issue #27, items jumping around the notifier's list (patch by Yevgen Muntyan)
    * fix issue #4, watch info pane contents centered instead of left aligned (patch by Yevgen Muntyan)
    * fix issue #29, murder dialog's cancel action makes specto crash
    * changed some 'help' URLs that still pointed to the old wiki

2007-06-02 Jean-Francois Fortin Tam
    * figure out if gconf values are set or not. Who needs stinking gconf schemas? Fixes issue #41.
    * kill the gconf subfolders '/apps/specto/preferences/' and '/apps/specto/ui/' by merging them in '/apps/specto/'. You can cleanup yours by running this command: "gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/specto"
    * flip the gconf keys in the right direction ("show_toolbar" instead of "hide_toolbar" which was an unelegant hack)
    * make some keys more obvious ("show_notifier" instead of "notifier_state")
    * add a hidden gconf key, "follow_website_redirects" (fixes issue #58)
    
2007-05-29 Jean-Francois Fortin Tam
    * add a "translator-credits" string that is translatable for the about dialog
    * write a script that creates a translation tarball for easy upload to Canonical's Rosetta
    * updated all translations to give credit where it is due
    * fix the turkish translation filenames

2007-05-10 Jean-Francois Fortin Tam
    * Happy birthday to myself ;)
    * Remove shebangs from non-scripts (chalserogers)
    * Fix ugly bugs in the file watch (chalserogers)
    * Remove remaining "territory marks" (as per previous discussion)
    * Make specto update its tray icon before notifying
    * Add a short delay between updating the tray and notifying (prevents misplaced balloons)
    * More error checking/reporting for web watch (chalserogers)
    * Don't crash on corrupt watch list (chalserogers)
    * Now possible to make icons transparent (woutc)
    * Make use of transparency everywhere. Remove useless code and comments
	* Remove useless icons since we can now make stock icons transparent
	* Fix remaining bits of modules that still wanted to use the old icons
    * Changes to the email counting logic, and more info for POP3 watches (woutc)
    * A statusbar now tells the user if there is no network connection detected (woutc)
    * Updated French translation
    * Added Turkish translation (Murat Güneş)
    * Updated Italian translation (Vincenzo Consales)
    * Don't screw up when opening files/folders with spaces
    * Work around evolution being really braindead (refusing to start with %s). This somewhat fixes the "go to" button with POP3 and IMAP watches

2007-03-18 Wout Clymans
    * Fixed issue #50: update the notifier infopane automatically
    * Implemented new Gconf module
    * Fixed some bugs
    * reverted port watch to original code (safer)

2007-03-13 Wout Clymans <woutclymans@pi.be>
    * Added import_export.glade
    * Updated watch_port so it works with ipv6 (or ssh localhost)

2007-03-07 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * clean up, rewrite a portion of port watch into something simpler
    * more themable icons
    * port watch is now available in the GUI, please test it. Fixes issue #32

2007-03-07 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * copy Wout's import_export.glade from 0.2 branch to trunk
    * usability and code fixes for the export dialog
    * translation fixes
    * updated French translation and template

2007-03-07 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * use the current GTK theme icons for pretty much everything. Cleans up the code in Notifier. Needs work! Any help much appreciated
    * use scalable vector graphics for the notification area icon
    * use scalable vector graphics for the notifier window titlebar (looks better with Avant Window Navigator)
    * make the "murder dialog" (when trying to quit specto during the first refresh) more HIG-compliant
    * update the translation template and the French translation

2007-02-22 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Committed a patch attached to Issue 45: "@gmail.com" appended to Gmail
    for your domain addresses. 
    Thanks to adamcrownoble for the report and patch!

2007-02-07  Christopher James Halse Rogers  <chalserogers@gmail.com>

	* Make the google-pinger smarter.  It will now ping a maximum of
	once every 10 minutes, and assume that the network is still in the
	previous state between pings.

2007-02-06  Christopher James Halse Rogers  <chalserogers@gmail.com>

	* Make the web and email watches network-aware.  These watches
	will now only attempt to update when a network connection is
	detected.  If a network connection is not detected, watch updates
	will get triggered when a connection is available again.
	* Remove the "ping google" at Specto startup code.  Obsoleted by
	the new connection-manager :)

2007-02-04 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Add network connection icons for a possible network watch (tells you how many times your connection dropped)
    * Kill the net/ folder, I have not been given reasons for its existence and it's breaking system-wide install
    * Remove some prints from watch.py (they were only useful for troubleshooting issue #40)

2007-02-02 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Remove a useless line in notifier.glade; the toolbar now follows gnome's global settings. Please folks, use glade3 if possible, not glade2, it's old and messy

2007-01-27 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Fix isue #5 sounds keep playing - this was due to the fact that the watches notified on each refresh if they were marked updated, even if they did not change! Therefore, we now use an additional variable: self.actually_updated
    * Fix issue #7 specify the libnotify balloon delay - you can now set a custom duration for balloons in the preferences
    * Code cleanup. Lots of little bits fixed.
    * Why did we have a function called specto.update_watch? That's pretty confusing. Renamed to specto.mark_watch_busy
    * Found a horrible, fat bug. Filed as issue #40, please help!
    * Added a lot of print functions in watch.py; these are necessary until we fix issue #40
    * Committed the italian translations. I forgot to add them!
    * Updated the french translation and the translations template file
    * Update the generate_template.py string generation script
    * Fix issue #25 /usr/share/pixmaps is deprecated. We now install an SVG icon directly into the HighContrast theme. You may need to sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor. If you are a package maintainer, please include that post-install task too.
    * Make all the watches display by default (reverse the display_all gconf key)

2007-01-27 Wout Clymans
    * Added a new watch type: process watch

2007-01-26 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Fix issue #28: implement the feature that allows not displaying the notifier in the window list applet in the panel (optional)
    * Make the blue icon lighter again

2007-01-23 Wout Clymans, Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Fix issue #4: content is left aligned
    * Fix issue #30: sort order is correctly saved
    * Fix issue #34: "display all watches" is checked at startup
    * extend the pango ellipsize behavior to a few other labels in the notifier window

2007-01-20 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * use pango to ellipsize (truncate) the webpage URIs shown in the notifier window. Better results and less hacks.

2007-01-05 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * late happy new year, folks :)
    * added back the launch.sh script. This is used only for those who do not want to install Specto and who face gnome's stupid launchers. Starting 
"specto" directly still works though.

2006-12-26 Wout Clymans
    * Export watches implemented

2006-12-23 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Fix the y position of the balloons appearing from the tray

    * Remove some useless translated strings, update de, fr, sv (thanks Daniel Nylander), it (thanks Giulio lotti) translations

2006-12-15 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Fixed issue #9, Specto can now be fully translated. Yes, that means glade files too! Go ahead and make Specto beautiful in your native language!
    * Updated translations template
    * Updated translations: fr, de (thanks Tobias)
    * Fixed translations that use plurals in our code

2006-12-15 Wout Clymans
    * Fixed issue #10 specto uses threads to update watches

2006-12-12 Jean-Francois Fortin
    * Finally killed libegg and use PyGTK's gtk.StatusIcon instead (fixes issue #8, requires pygtk 2.10)
    * The tray icon is not persistent as a default: you have to enable it in the preferences now. This is for HIG purposes.
    * Killed the traypopup module, it really was useless, I merged it in trayicon
    * Libnotify balloons are finally attached to the tray icon!
    * Make the utils module return absolute paths
    * Fix issue #16: icons do not show in balloons
    * Display a minimal libnotify balloon when something goes wrong with a watch
    * Code cleanup

2006-12-12 Wout Clymans
    * Fix issue #3 a dialog is shown with the question to kill specto
    * Fix issue #22 (hopefully) for mail SSL support

2006-12-09 Jean-François Fortin
    * Fix issue #23 (hopefully) where specto thought it was already running if another app stole its process ID
    * Fix issue #26 (partly) by adding the executable bit to the file "specto"
    * Add the SV translation taken from Rosetta (Daniel Nylander)

2006-11-18 Jean-François Fortin
    * Feature added: checks for network connectivity before starting by trying to open google.com. If it fails, it sleeps for 10 seconds.
    * Fix a few path bugs
    * Fix a traceback that happened when you edited a gmail watch because main.py tried to grab the Host

2006-11-15 Jean-François Fortin
    * Fix issue #2 where the watches.list would mess up if you cleared all watches after removing one, or if you removed a watch during the first update process.

2006-11-12 Thomas McColgan
    * Specto now runs locally. This breaks setup.py and the ability to install Specto system-wide.

2006-10-26 Wout Clymans
    * Added SSL support for pop3/imap email watches

2006-10-24 Giulio lotti, Jean-François Fortin & Thomas McColgan
    * gettext support, finally Specto can be translated into different languages !
    * new and better (translatable) quicktips
    * small bug fixes
    * added French translation
    * added Romanian translation, thanks to Adrian Petrescu
    * generic stuff for the 0.1 release (cleanup, roadmap, todos, etc)
    
2006-10-21 Jean-François Fortin
    * (bug #65931) removing a watch did not remove "updated = False", which caused crashes and corruption

2006-10-19 Wout Clymans
    * code cleanup and documentation for the functions added

2006-10-15 Giulio Lotti
    * proper libnotify support. The dependency on libnotify-bin is now deprecated for a dependency on python-notify

    * (bug #55324) display the toolbar by default

2006-09-13 Jean-François Fortin
    * (bug #60261) no action associated with file watch - it now opens the parent directory containing the file

2006-09-13 Jean-François Fortin
    * gmail watches now clear themselves when your unread message count reaches zero
    * this introduces bug #60279

2006-09-13 Wout Clymans
